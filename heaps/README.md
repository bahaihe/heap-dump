How to test
-----------
You need [JDK 8 Update
112](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html#jdk-8u112-oth-JPR)
installed in `/opt/java/` to make this work.

As of this point, updates to glibc have already made these files useless; I'm
working on a way to generate them instead of checking them in to source
control.
